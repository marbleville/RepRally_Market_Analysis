1. Every Item in the top 20 highest performing products is some type of snack or candy. Gummies, chips, crackers, 
snacks, and jerky make up the top 20, showing the strength of the snack market. Sancks make a strong market for several 
reasons, cost, popularity, and low barriers of entry. Snacks are easy to make, easy to store, and easy to transport. 
This incentivizes many companies to enter the market, and the competition drives down prices. This makes snacks an easy 
choice for consumers as they require no prep and have very low prices. 

2. Marketing and consumer awareness obviously plays a huge role in the success of these products. The top 20 products are 
all in well known categories. Beyond that, these products lean into the huge amrket for quick and easy snacks. The average 
American spends more on eating out than on cooking at home, indicating that most people are looking for fast and delicious 
food day to day with less regard to heath. These products are all in categories that are easy to eat on the go, and are all 
very popular.

3. The underperforming products are mostly in more niche categories. Producs like bacon jam and and paleo granola 
underperform compared to more popoular products becasue these fit into few consuermers' lives. To imporve performance, 
the companies promoting these products should focus on marketing to the niche markets that would be interested in these
more niche products. Alternatively, they could try to rebrand the products to fit into more popular categories. For
example, the paleo granola could be rebranded as a healthy snack that just happens to be paleo, fitting into more markets.
