1. Every Item in the top 20 highest performing products is some type of snack or candy. Gummies, chips, crackers, 
and jerky make up the top 20, showing the strench of the snack market. Sancks make a strong market for several reasons,
cost, popularity, and low barriers of entry. Snacks are easy to make, easy to store, and easy to transport. This 
incentivizes many companies to enter the market, and the competition drives down prices. This makes snacks an easy 
choice for consumers as they require not cooking and have very low prices. 

2. Marketing obviously plays a huge role in the success of these products. The top 20 products are all in well known 
categories. Beyond that, these products lean into the huge amrket for quick and easy snacks. The average American spends
more on eating out than on cookking at home, indicatin that most people are looking for fast and good tasting food day 
to day. These products are all in categories that are easy to eat on the go, and are all very popular.

3. The underperforming products are mostly in moe niche categories. Producs like bacon jam and and paleo granola 
underperform compared to more popoular products becasue these fit into few consuermers' lives. To imporve performance, 
the companies promoting their products should focus on marketing to the niche markets that would be interested in these
more niche products. Alternatively, they could try to rebrand the products to fit into more popular categories. For
example, the paleo granola could be rebranded as a healthy snack that just happens to be paleo, fitting into more markets.
